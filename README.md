## Hi there 👋

<!--
**mattburnett-repo/mattburnett-repo** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:
-->

- 🔭 I’m currently working on [activist.org](https://github.com/activist-org/activist) (Vue + TypeScript + Django).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the Scrapy webscraping ecosystem.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on projects that are socially beneficial and/or climate positive.

My interest in web programming / development started in the early 90's, when I discovered how to author Windows 3.1 help files. The idea of hypertext opened up a world of possibilities.

Since then I have followed interests that pursue the idea of capturing, processing and presenting information. For 15 years I worked as a developer during the Web 1.0 era, in the US government space. I ended up taking a break from that to pursue other interests, and after a relocation to Berlin I upskilled a few years ago to the current web development technologies.

My main interest is in making things that are useful, and making things that already exist better.
