## Hi there 👋

<!--
**mattburnett-repo/mattburnett-repo** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:
-->

- 🔭 Developer working on [Activist.org](https://github.com/activist-org/activist), a project built with Vue, TypeScript, and Django, as well as [Servepoint](https://github.com/mattburnett-repo/servepoint), a Work-In-Progress enterprise-grade ColdFusion / ColdBox demo application showcasing modern architecture, integration, security, privacy, and deployment best practices.
- 🌱 Actively expanding my skills by diving into ColdBox and preparing for the Java SE 17 Developer certification.
- 🏅 Adobe Certified ColdFusion Professional.
- 👯 Open to collaborating on projects that are socially beneficial, climate-positive, or that simply improve people's lives. Let's build something great together!

Recently I have contributed to open source projects such as [Resonate.coop](https://github.com/resonatecoop/) and [Activist.org](https://github.com/activist-org). For Resonate.coop I implemented a [complete testing process](https://github.com/resonatecoop/api/blob/main/test/README.md). For Activist.org I currently work on the project's open issues to implement new functionality, from frontend to backend.

My main interest is in making things that are useful, and making things that already exist better.
