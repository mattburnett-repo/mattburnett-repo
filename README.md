## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<!--
**mattburnett-repo/mattburnett-repo** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:
-->

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on [Activist.org](https://github.com/activist-org/activist) (Vue + TypeScript + Django).
- ðŸŒ± Right now I'm investigating ColdBox and studying for the Java SE 17 Developer certificaion exam.
- ðŸ‘¯ It would be great to collaborate on projects that are socially beneficial, climate positive, or just make life better for people.

Recently I have contributed to open source projects such as [Resonate.coop](https://github.com/resonatecoop/) and [Activist.org](https://github.com/activist-org). For Resonate.coop I implemented a [complete testing process](https://github.com/resonatecoop/api/blob/main/test/README.md). For Activist.org I currently work on the project's open issues to implement new functionality, from frontend to backend.

My main interest is in making things that are useful, and making things that already exist better.
